# Titanic EDA – Data Science Task 2 🚢

This project is part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, where I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## 🔍 Overview
The Titanic dataset provides details on passengers aboard the Titanic, and this analysis focuses on:
- Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling
- Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
- Visual storytelling using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Feature engineering (like Family Size)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Women and children had significantly higher survival rates.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Age distribution shows most passengers were between 20–40 years old.
- A heatmap shows correlations between survival and other features.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Google Colab
- Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## 📁 Files Included
